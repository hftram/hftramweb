  "description": "* Line charts now have a new tooltip option available. This new tooltip displays all series information at once, and shows up anywhere your mouse moves. To enable, set **useInteractiveGuideline** to true. See examples in the **test/** directory for how this tooltip works. * New test pages have been created for various kinds of charts. They live in the **test/** directory. The goal of these test pages is to aid in regression testing coverage when changes are made to charts. * Pie charts accept data in a different way, and if you update to version 1.1, **your pie charts will break**. See the pie chart examples for how data should be properly passed in. It's a very simple change. * Pie charts can now accept a 'labelType' property.  * Tooltip transitions are **turned off** by default, if you update to the latest nv.d3.css.  To bring them back, add a 'with-transitions' CSS class to the containing chart DIV. * Stacked area charts have transitions again. Duration is controlled via a 'transitionDuration' property. * Line, cumulative, scatter, multi bar and discrete bar charts also have the 'transitionDuration' property. * Issue #127: Adding ability to override individual scatter plot point colors. * Issue #216: Exposing xRange and yRange overrides for all charts. * Issue #168: Adding legend.radioButtonMode(). When set to true, legend click behavior will match those of radio buttons. * Line stroke-width has been reduced to 1.5px, from 2.5px. * Hover points on line and stacked area charts are now a small solid dot, instead of a large ring. * Added Multibar chart property \"groupSpacing\". * Charts now have a method called \"options()\", where you can pass in chart configurations via an object. * examples/index.html page created, for quick access to all NVD3 examples and test pages.",
